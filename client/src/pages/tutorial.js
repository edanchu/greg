        <h2 className='tut-header'>Fragment Shader Basics</h2>
        <p className='tut-p'>
          Fragment shaders (also known as pixel shaders) are programs that are
          run for every fragment within an output image. For our purposes, this
          means every pixel on the output canvas. Fragment shaders take input in
          the form of Uniforms, perform calculations based on these inputs, and
          then output a color in RGBA format. Within GLSL ES 3.0 (the shader
          language we are using) this means outputing a vec4 of floats between
          0.0 and 1.0. For a more complete undestanding of how GLSL and shaders
          in general work,

        <h2 className='tut-header'>Our Implementation</h2>

        <p className='tut-p'>
          The fragment shaders that can be written on Greg all implement the
          <code> void mainImage(out vec4 FragColor) </code> method as an entry
          point. This is called once per pixel and is responsible for the final
          output color to the screen. Our shaders also implement a series of
          shader passes that we call buffers. Buffers 1-4 are all fragment
          shaders that render to internal textures that are passed on to each
          following buffer. Eg, Buffer2 has access to the output of Buffer1,
          while Buffer4 has access to Buffers 1-3, and Main has access to all 4
          buffers. These buffers all have the same resolution and can be
          accessed like normal textures. Their outputs all follow the same
          format as Main. (These buffers can be used to layer images on top of
          each other, create post-processing effects, or to perform
          calculations).
        </p>

        <h2 className='tut-header'>Basic GLSL</h2>

        <p className='tut-p'>
          GLSL is a strongly typed c-like language that is specifically designed
          for use with graphics shaders. Fragment shaders in GLSL have access to
          a large set of built in functions that are useful for graphics
          calculations such as
          <code>
            {' '}
            dot(vec3 a, vec3 b), sin(float a), reflect(vec2-4 I, vec 2-4 N),
            distance(vec2-4 a, vec2-4 b){' '}
          </code>{' '}
          as well as built in variables that give information about the current
          fragment being processed. The most useful of these is
          <code> gl_FragCoord </code> which is a vec4 which stores positional
          information about the current Fragment. Only the x and y components
          are of interest to us. For a complete list of built in functions and
          variables,{' '}

        <h2 className='tut-header'>Uniforms</h2>

        <p className='tut-p'>
          Uniforms are read-only variables that are passed in to shaders. Greg
          provides a set of commonly used uniforms that can be accessed from
          within each buffer:
          <dl>
            <dt>
              <strong>float iTime</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>The time in ms that the shader has been running.</dd>

            <dt>
              <strong>float iDeltaTime</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>The time in ms since the previous frame.</dd>

            <dt>
              <strong>int iFrame</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>The number of frames that have been rendered thus far.</dd>

            <dt>
              <strong>vec4 iMouse</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              The mouse location in pixels. [x, y, last click location x, last
              click location y].
            </dd>

            <dt>
              <strong>sampler2D iKeyboard</strong>
            </dt>
            <dd>
              A 256x1 texture representing the keyboard's state. Each keyboard
              key is stored under it's ascii code and stores information in a
              vec4 of floats.
              <br />
              Index 0 is either 1.0 or 0.0 representing if the key is currently
              pressed.
              <br /> Index 1 follows the same convention but is toggeled every
              time the key is pressed.
              <br />
              Index 2 stores the last frame that the key was pressed %256 and
              normalized to be between 0.0 and 1.0.
              <br />
              Index 3 is unused.

              <strong>vec4 iDate</strong>
            </dt>

              A vector of 4 elements representing the current date. [year,
              month, day, seconds]

            <dd>
              Textures storing the output from each Buffer. Each Buffer has
              access to the output of every previous Buffer, Main has all of
              them. Resolution of iResolution.

            <dd>
              Textures or Cubemaps containing user defined data chosen from a
              pre-existing pool. Each Buffer has access to its own set of
              channels. Each channel's resolution depends on the chosen data.
            </dd>
